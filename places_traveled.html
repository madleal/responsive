				<p>The places I've traveled too.  I haven't been everywhere but it's on my bukectlist.
				Since I was a little girl my yearly trips to Mexico to visit family I was exposed to the possibility of traveling outside the United States.  My parents both immigrants from Mexico came to the United States in pursuit of the "American Dream."  As I got older I began to toy with the idea that I would also become a world traveler one day.  As someone from a low income household traveling was a luxury that was only afforded to those with the privilege to hop on a plane and leave.  I began to save my money and put somethings in action.</p>

				<p>Fast forward almost a decade later and I've been privileged enough to travel to many different places and collect some pretty cool memories.  These memories manifest themselves in my tattoo collection.  I decided that everywhere I go I would collect a small tatoo as a way to cement my adventure to that specific location.  Some tattoos hold very personal emotions and stages in my life.  As I continue to grow and evolve into the woman that I am today, I like to share what each tatoo means to me.</p>


				<p>List of places I've traveled to:
				Within the United States: New York, New Jersey, Boston Massachusetts, Miami Florida, San Antonio Texas, Chicago Illinois, Seattle Washington, Hawaii, Nevada, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Washington D.C.</p>

				<p>International:  Hanoi Vietnam, Edinburgh Scotland, Bangkok Thailand, Bogota Colombia, Peru, Mexico (Sinaloa, Jalisco, Cancun), Cape Town South Africa</p>
