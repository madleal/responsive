            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Boston Massachusetts, 2010: The word Confident in Greek</h2>
            <!-- In addition also link each title of the tattoo to the pictures page corresponding to each tattoo image. -->
            <p>This was my first tattoo.  I went to visit a friend in Boston and we were exploring the Harvard campus.  Upon taking a small detour my friend mentioend she was interested in getting her next tattoo.  I told her that I had been considering getting my first tattoo and already had something in mind.  As we were climbing up the escalators "Chameleon Tattoo" greeted us at the top.  As if by faith we both looked at each other and smiled.</p>

            <p>I got the word Confident in Greek for two reason.  One, I wanted a constant reminder to always be confident.  That year I had was going through really hard times. Personally I was struggling to remain confident in myself.  Two, Greek mythology fascinated me and I had studied Greek art history in high school.  I always admired Greek society and found them to be resilient. </p> 

            <p>Confident for me means to believe and love thyself.</p>

            <h2> <i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Hawaii, 2011: Chameleon</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2011 I took a spontaneous trip to Oahu Hawaii with some of my close college friends.  The trip itself was one of my favorite girls trip and was filled with a lot of love and laugh out loud moments.  I was getting out of a dark period in my life and this trip was a reminder that life is too short to be spent crying over things I couldn't change.  I was discovering that I was an adaptable being and the thing I loved most about myself is my ability to blend in or stand out. </p>

            <p>The Chameleon often takes the form and color of its environment.  But I also associate chameleons to be colorful symbols and adaptation.  I adapt but I also stand out.  So came my idea of getting a chameleon tattoo. </p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Seatlle Washington, 2013: Feather with the world Travel</h2>
            <p>Ever taken a girls trip with your bestie on Valentines day?  I have.  On the eve of Valentines day one of my bestfriends from high school and I took a trip to Seattle.  It was something that we'd had always wanted to do. This trip was one of my favorite trips.  I decided that I wanted something to remind me of the one time that Nicole and I went to Seattle and spent the majority of our time laughing at our silly selves.  I remember laughing so much that our stomachs ached from all the laughter.</p>

            <p>The feather tattoo I got reminds me of the time that we went to Seattle. I had the word travel written underneath it to remind me to always remember to travel to different places.  I want to live a life of adventure and traveling fun.  I think I've been doing just that.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Hanoi Vietnam, 2015: Elephant Tattoo</h2>
            <p>Spring 2015 I had the opportunity to travel to Hanoi Vietnam.  It was my first time I had to travel on a plane for 14 hours.  I had been to Mexico before, but this was the first time I had to cross the great vast ocean.  Vietnam for me was a beautiful adventure.  I got lost in the city and ventured solo. I got an elephant tatoo for nothing more than for luck.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Edinburgh Scotland, 2015: Unicorn Tattoo</h2>
            <p> December 2015 I got the opportunity to visit Scotland (one beautiful country might I add).  It was my first time in Europe and absolutely loved my experience there.  During my time there I got to visit many castles which made this trip even more magical.  During one of my visits at Edingburgh Castle I found out that the country's animal emblem was the unicorn!  Imagine being in a castle and discovering that the animal that lives on the country's flag was a Unicorn.  I appreciated that fact so much that I automatically knew that my next tattoo was going to be...a Unicorn. </p>

            <p> Besides it being the country's official animal a unicorn for me represents my uniqueness.  Its a way to celebrate that I am in fact a unique unicorn. Oh, and if you have the chance to visit Scotland, please do so it's an amazing and magical place! </p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Lima Peru, 2017:  Llama Tattoo, Sunflower and Lily Flower Tattoos, Wonder Woman</h2>
            <p>Summer 2017 was life changing.  I had the opportunity to spend 13 weeks in beautiful Lima, Peru.  Not only was the work I was doing there meaningful the whole experience being in Peru was by far my favorite travel experience ever.  These tattoos for me hold the most meaning and capture what I experienced in Peru the best.  I can't publicly share the personal significance of each tattoo on here, I will share a snippet of each's meaning.</p>

            <p>Sunflowers are my favorite flowers.  I was once told by someone very special to me that I was a sunflower amongst a field of weeds.  I interpreted to mean that my spirit/my personality brings light and joy to people.</p>

            <p> I became obsessed with Woman Woman when I bought my first Wonder Woman comic book.  I then went on a venture to research and learn more about her origins.  In high school, my favorite class was Art History (shout out to Patty Guilino!)  Wonder Woman is from an island of women from the Amazon.  Throughout the years she's been the most consistent iconic femal hero and for me she's a beacon of everything empowering I wish to be one day.  When the movie came out summer 2017 I literally cried.  The young girl in me was enthralled to finally see a female hero action movie in theaters.  What made it even more special was that I watched it in Peru!  So after watching the movie I went over to my favorite tattoo parlor and asked my tattoo guy to engrave the wonder woman emblem on my left arm as a symbol of the warrior princess I embody...everyday.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i> Bogota Colombia, 2017: Hummingbird over Lotus Flower</h2>
            <p> If you ever have the opportunity to travel to Colombia, don't think twice about it!  Go.  The land of enchantment and misconceptions from an outsider's perception.  Colombia was that one spontaneous trip that I took while I was in Peru. I had a strong inclination to hop on a plane and experience Colombia first hand.  Many people that I had spoken to told me that it was a beautiful coountry.  So during my time in Peru, I booked a weekend to Bogota.  Literally, I only spent four days and how I wished that I had spent a longer time!</p>

            <p>Bogota, is huge! And unfortunately, I didn't get to see everything but I saw enough for me to fall in love and feel the need to return.  In Bogota, I explore the streets of the Candelaria alone.  But I was never alone because I ended up meeting really cool people.  The four days I spent there I met locals that invited me to their homes and invited me to a film festival.  I was so fascinated by the hospitality.  As I was walking down the street back to my hostel I noticed a tattoo shop.  The artist was having a weekend special.  For $30 I got a small tattoo to immortalize my time in Colombia. A hummingbird hovering over a lotus flower.  A symbol to always live in the moment and always seek for the good in life. "Hummingbirds remind us to stay adaptable and to accept the reality of change with a happy heart."(insert link here)  Colombia was a reminder to seek the magic in life.  I thought it was appropriate to get a tattoo to celebrate that.Freedom to enjoy the sweet side of life. </p>
